/// Calculates the visible rectangle for an expand/collapse animation.

/// This function interpolates the notification size from/to a minimum size (3x3)
/// while keeping the notification centered during the animation.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `full_rect` - The full rectangle of the notification when fully expanded
/// * `_frame_area` - The frame area (ignored for expand/collapse animations)
/// * `phase` - The current animation phase
/// * `progress` - The animation progress (0.0 to 1.0)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The interpolated rectangle at the current animation progress
///
/// # Examples
